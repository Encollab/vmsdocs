# Vehicle Management Module

## Overview

The Vehicle Management module provides comprehensive vehicle lifecycle management capabilities for automotive organizations. Designed to handle everything from individual vehicle records to large-scale fleet operations, the system delivers the flexibility and control needed to manage vehicles throughout their entire lifecycle while maintaining seamless integration with warranty, budget, and external business systems.

## Core Vehicle Management

### Vehicle Data Structure

The vehicle management system maintains comprehensive records for each vehicle with both standard and configurable fields. Core vehicle identification includes internal and external vehicle numbers, VIN (Vehicle Identification Number), equipment numbers, and batch tracking. Financial data captures gross pricing, currency specifications, and current mileage readings. Temporal tracking includes registration dates, production timestamps, and status update timestamps.

Each vehicle record links to multiple business partners including vendors, customers, sales order customers, and end customers, providing complete ownership and transaction history. The system supports both new and used vehicle tracking with appropriate flagging and archival capabilities for lifecycle management.

### Vehicle Models

Vehicle models form the foundation of the vehicle hierarchy, containing material numbers, model names, descriptions, base pricing, and currency information. Models link to multiple vehicles, enabling consistent data management and reporting across vehicle variants. The model structure supports both standard manufacturer models and custom configurations for specialized vehicles.

### Vehicle Classifications

Extensive classification capabilities organize vehicles across multiple dimensions:
- **Vehicle Status**: Current operational state of the vehicle
- **Availability**: Sales availability indicators
- **Visibility**: Display control for different user groups
- **Vehicle Usage**: Intended use categories (fleet, demo, retail, etc.)
- **Sales Campaign**: Marketing campaign associations
- **Plant and Storage Location**: Physical location tracking
- **Valuation Type**: Financial categorization
- **Shelf Level**: Inventory aging classifications

Each classification supports configurable values, enabling organizations to adapt the system to their specific business terminology and processes.

### Search and List Management

The vehicle search system provides comprehensive query capabilities across all standard and custom fields. Users can search using exact matches, partial text, wildcards, and complex combinations of criteria. The search infrastructure supports both simple queries for daily operations and sophisticated analysis for business intelligence.

List management features configurable views with:
- Column selection and ordering
- Multi-level sorting
- Advanced filtering with saved filter sets
- Bulk operations on selected vehicles
- Export capabilities for external analysis
- Real-time updates reflecting system changes

### Field Control System

Granular field controls determine data visibility and editability based on context and user permissions. The system supports:
- **Hidden Fields**: Complete removal from user interface
- **Read-Only Fields**: Visible but not editable
- **Optional Fields**: Editable but not required
- **Mandatory Fields**: Required for data progression

Field controls apply to over 30 vehicle-level fields, with separate configurations for internal and external users. Status-dependent controls ensure appropriate data access throughout the vehicle lifecycle.

## Vehicle Configuration System

### Configuration Templates

The advanced configuration system manages complex vehicle option structures through templates. Each template defines:
- Option groups organized by category (powertrain, exterior, interior, technology)
- Single-select and multi-select option types
- Required and optional selections
- Model-specific applicability
- Default selections and pricing

Templates support different model types (sedan, SUV, electric) with appropriate option sets for each vehicle category.

### Option Management

Options within configuration templates include:
- Readable codes and descriptions
- Individual pricing with currency specifications
- Material associations for parts tracking
- Constraint definitions (requires, excludes, implies)
- Metadata for additional properties
- Active status and sort ordering

The system maintains relationships between options, ensuring valid configurations through constraint validation.

### Constraint Resolution

A sophisticated constraint resolution engine validates vehicle configurations in real-time:
- **Requires Constraints**: Options that must be selected together
- **Excludes Constraints**: Mutually exclusive options
- **Implies Constraints**: Options that automatically include others
- Session-based configuration tracking
- Real-time validation with error messaging
- Total price calculation based on selections

Configuration sessions maintain state throughout the selection process, providing immediate feedback on invalid combinations and guiding users toward valid configurations.

```

### Third-Party Configuration

Integration with external configuration systems enables:
- Import of manufacturer configuration data
- Synchronization with configurator tools
- Validation against external rule engines
- Real-time configuration updates
- Characteristic name-value pair management

Each vehicle can maintain multiple configurations with characteristic names, values, and descriptions, supporting complex technical specifications and customer preferences.

## Budget Management

### Vehicle Budget Planning

The comprehensive budget system manages vehicle allocation planning across multiple dimensions. Annual budgets track planned vehicle quantities by:
- Model year specifications
- Vehicle model types
- Six configurable attributes for detailed categorization
- Monthly allocation breakdowns (12 months)
- Version control for budget iterations

Budget types support different planning scenarios (IC/OC/IV/OV) with separate tracking for incoming and outgoing vehicles across claimant and vendor channels.

### Dealer Distribution

Dealer distribution functionality allocates budgeted vehicles to specific dealers:
- Dealer-specific allocation from master budgets
- Monthly distribution planning
- Percentage-based or unit-based allocation
- Variance tracking against budgets
- Status indicators (Not Allocated, Under Allocated, Fully Allocated, Over Allocated)

Distribution views provide real-time visibility into allocation status, helping organizations optimize inventory distribution across their dealer network.

### Dealer Adjustments

Dealers can refine allocated budgets within defined constraints:
- Request adjustments to allocated quantities
- Maintain audit trail of adjustment requests
- Constraint validation against distribution limits
- Future workflow support for approval processes
- Historical tracking of all adjustments

### Budget Analytics

Built-in analytical views provide insights into budget performance:
- Budget versus allocation comparisons
- Variance calculations and percentages
- Dealer allocation summaries
- Model-level aggregations
- Temporal trend analysis

Virtual fields automatically calculate allocation percentages, variance amounts, and status indicators, providing immediate visibility into budget utilization.

## Custom Fields and Extensions

### Dynamic Field System

The custom field framework enables organizations to extend vehicle records without system modification:
- **Field Types**: Text, boolean, number, date, datetime, and textarea
- **Configuration Options**: Required status, editability, default values
- **Entity Support**: Vehicle-specific custom fields
- **Usage Tracking**: Automatic counting of field utilization

Custom fields integrate fully with standard functionality including search, filtering, export, and reporting capabilities.

### Text Management

Configurable text types organize narrative information:
- Multiple text types per vehicle
- Icon and category assignments
- Language-specific content
- Version tracking for text changes
