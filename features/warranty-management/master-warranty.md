# Master Warranty Profiles

## Overview

Master Warranty Profiles define coverage parameters that automatically determine claim eligibility. By establishing time and mileage-based coverage rules, financial responsibilities, and inclusion specifications, the system validates warranty coverage instantly without manual verification.

## How It Works

### Profile Structure

Each warranty profile contains:
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Coverage Parameters"
        Time[Time Limits]
        Mileage[Mileage Limits]
        Parts[Parts Coverage]
        Labor[Labor Coverage]
    end
    
    subgraph "Financial Rules"
        OEM[OEM Percentage]
        Dealer[Dealer Share]
        Vendor[Vendor Portion]
    end
    
    subgraph "Validity"
        Model[Vehicle Model]
        Dates[Valid Period]
        Conditions[Special Conditions]
    end
    
    Time --> Model
    Mileage --> Model
    Parts --> OEM
    Labor --> Dealer
```

## Key Features

### Coverage Definition
- **Time-Based Coverage**: Min/max days from purchase
- **Mileage-Based Coverage**: Min/max mileage ranges
- **Parts Inclusion**: Coverage for replacement parts
- **Labor Inclusion**: Coverage for repair labor
- **Combined Criteria**: Time AND mileage requirements

### Financial Configuration
Split financial responsibility:
- **OEM Share**: Manufacturer contribution percentage
- **Dealer Share**: Dealer responsibility portion
- **Vendor Share**: Third-party vendor allocation
- Total must equal 100% for valid configuration

### Profile Management
- Link to specific vehicle models
- Set temporal validity periods
- Define special conditions
- Version control for changes
- Active/inactive status

## Coverage Validation

### Automatic Checks
When a claim is submitted:
1. Identify applicable warranty profiles
2. Check vehicle age against time limits
3. Verify mileage within parameters
4. Confirm parts/labor inclusion
5. Calculate financial splits

### Validation Results
- **Covered**: Full coverage confirmed
- **Partial**: Limited coverage available
- **Expired**: Outside coverage parameters
- **Not Applicable**: No matching profile
