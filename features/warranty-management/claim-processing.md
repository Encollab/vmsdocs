# Claim Processing

## Overview

The claim processing system provides end-to-end management of warranty claims from initial submission through final resolution. With comprehensive data capture, automatic validation, and complete audit trails, the system ensures accurate and efficient warranty operations while maintaining compliance requirements.

## How It Works

### Claim Structure

Claims follow a hierarchical structure with header information and detailed line items:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Claim Components"
        Header[Claim Header]
        Items[Line Items]
        Financial[Financial Data]
        Documents[Attachments]
    end
    
    subgraph "Relationships"
        Vehicle[Vehicle Link]
        Partner[Business Partner]
        Campaign[Campaign Association]
        Template[Template Reference]
    end
    
    Header --> Items
    Header --> Financial
    Header --> Documents
    
    Header --> Vehicle
    Header --> Partner
    Header --> Campaign
    Header --> Template
```

### Core Claim Data
- **Claim Number**: Auto-generated unique identifier
- **Authorization Number**: Approval reference
- **Partner Information**: Dealer/service center details
- **Date Tracking**: Registration, repair, and damage dates
- **Usage Metrics**: Mileage and operating hours
- **Status Flags**: Manual, closed, active, pricing complete

## Key Features

### Claim Classification
Multiple classification dimensions organize claims:
- **Claim Type**: Warranty category classification
- **Claim Group**: Functional grouping
- **Coverage Type**: Specific coverage application
- **Origin**: Source of claim initiation
- **Status**: Current processing state

### Line Item Management
Each claim supports multiple line items with:
- Material type and specifications
- Quantity and unit of measure
- Four-way financial tracking (IC/IV/OC/OV)
- Causal part identification
- Return flag management
- Pricing completion status

### Financial Model
The IC/IV/OC/OV financial structure tracks:
- **IC (Incoming Claimant)**: Costs from claimant
- **IV (Incoming Vendor)**: Vendor charges
- **OC (Outgoing Claimant)**: Claimant payments
- **OV (Outgoing Vendor)**: Vendor payments

This model provides complete cost transparency and margin analysis.

### Validation System
Automatic validation ensures claim accuracy:
- Coverage eligibility verification
- Date and mileage range checking
- Required field completion
- Business rule evaluation
- Documentation requirements

## Benefits

- **Accuracy**: Validation reduces errors and rejections
- **Efficiency**: Streamlined processing saves time
- **Transparency**: Complete visibility into claim status
- **Compliance**: Audit trails meet regulatory requirements
- **Financial Control**: Detailed cost tracking and analysis
