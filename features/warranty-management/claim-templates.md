# Claim Templates

## Overview

Claim templates streamline warranty processing by providing pre-configured claim structures for common repair scenarios. Service advisors can quickly create accurate claims by selecting appropriate templates that automatically populate standard information, reducing data entry time and minimizing errors.

## How It Works

Templates store complete claim configurations that can be reused across multiple claims. When selected, the template populates:
- Claim classifications (type, group, coverage)
- Standard line items with parts and labor
- Financial allocations
- Documentation requirements
- Processing instructions

```

## Key Features

### Template Components
- **Identification**: Template ID and description
- **Classifications**: Pre-set claim type, group, and status
- **Line Items**: Standard materials and quantities
- **Financial Defaults**: Cost allocations and pricing
- **Instructions**: Processing notes and requirements

### Template Management
- Create new templates from scratch
- Copy from existing claims
- Version control for changes
- Active/inactive status
- Usage tracking and analytics

### Dual Purpose
Templates serve two primary functions:
1. **Individual Claims**: Quick creation of service claims
2. **Campaign Foundation**: Base for recall and service campaigns

## Benefits

- **Speed**: Reduce claim creation time by 70%
- **Accuracy**: Eliminate common data entry errors
- **Consistency**: Standardize claim processing
- **Training**: Simplify new employee onboarding
