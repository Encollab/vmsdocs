# Custom Fields

## Overview

The custom fields system enables organizations to extend vehicle records with business-specific data without system modification. This powerful extensibility ensures the system adapts to unique requirements while maintaining full integration with standard features like search, filtering, and reporting.

## How It Works

Custom fields are dynamically added to vehicle records through configuration rather than code changes. Each field is fully integrated into the system, appearing in user interfaces, search functions, and data exports as if it were a standard field.

### Field Creation Process
1. Define field properties (name, type, requirements)
2. Assign to vehicle entity
3. Configure display and validation rules
4. Field immediately available in all interfaces

## Key Features

### Field Types

**Text Fields**
- Single-line text input
- Character limit configuration
- Pattern validation support

**Textarea Fields**
- Multi-line text entry
- Rich text formatting options
- Character counting

**Number Fields**
- Integer or decimal values
- Min/max range validation
- Unit specifications

**Boolean Fields**
- Checkbox/toggle representation
- Default value setting
- Conditional logic triggers

**Date Fields**
- Date-only selection
- Date range validation
- Relative date calculations

**DateTime Fields**
- Combined date and time
- Timezone handling
- Timestamp precision

### Field Configuration
- **Required Status**: Make fields mandatory or optional
- **Default Values**: Pre-populate with standard values
- **Editability Rules**: Control when fields can be modified
- **Validation Rules**: Ensure data quality and consistency
- **Help Text**: Provide guidance for data entry

### Integration Features
- Full search capabilities across custom fields
- Include in list views and reports
- Export with standard data
- API access for integrations
- Audit trail tracking

## Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Adapt to changing business requirements instantly
- **No Code Changes**: Add fields through configuration interface
- **Preservation**: Maintain custom fields through system upgrades
- **Consistency**: Same capabilities as standard fields
- **Scalability**: Add unlimited custom fields as needed

## Usage Tracking

The system monitors custom field utilization:
- Track which fields are actively used
- Identify unused fields for cleanup
- Analyze field value patterns
- Optimize based on usage data

## Configuration Examples

### Fleet Management Fields
```yaml
Fleet ID:
  type: text
  required: true
  description: "Internal fleet identifier"
  
Lease Expiry:
  type: date
  required: false
  validation: "Must be future date"
  
Monthly Mileage Limit:
  type: number
  default: 1000
  min: 0
  max: 10000
```

### Dealer-Specific Fields
```yaml
Showroom Location:
  type: text
  required: false
  values: ["Main", "Satellite", "Storage"]
  
Demo Vehicle:
  type: boolean
  default: false
  
Customer Reserve Date:
  type: datetime
  validation: "Cannot be past date"
```

## Use Cases

### Regulatory Compliance
Add fields required by local regulations:
- Emission certificates
- Safety inspection dates
- Registration renewal dates
- Tax identification numbers

### Business Operations
Capture organization-specific data:
- Internal cost centers
- Department assignments
- Project allocations
- Marketing campaign codes

### Customer Information
Track additional customer preferences:
- Preferred contact times
- Special requirements
- Loyalty program data
- Communication preferences

## Best Practices

1. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear, consistent field names
2. **Documentation**: Document field purpose and usage
3. **Validation**: Implement appropriate validation rules
4. **Cleanup**: Regularly review and remove unused fields
5. **Training**: Ensure users understand custom field purposes
