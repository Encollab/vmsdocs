# Search and List Management

## Overview

The vehicle search and list management system provides comprehensive query capabilities across all vehicle data fields. Users can quickly find specific vehicles or analyze entire fleets through flexible search options and customizable list views that adapt to different operational needs.

## How It Works

### Search Capabilities

The search infrastructure supports multiple query types to accommodate different user needs and data scenarios:

- **Exact Matching**: Find vehicles by precise VIN, license plate, or ID
- **Partial Text Search**: Locate vehicles with incomplete information
- **Wildcard Queries**: Use patterns to find groups of related vehicles
- **Complex Criteria**: Combine multiple fields with AND/OR logic
- **Cross-Field Search**: Query across standard and custom fields simultaneously

### List Management

Configurable list views provide tailored data presentation:

- **Column Selection**: Choose which fields to display
- **Custom Ordering**: Arrange columns for optimal workflow
- **Multi-Level Sorting**: Sort by multiple fields hierarchically
- **Advanced Filtering**: Apply complex filter combinations
