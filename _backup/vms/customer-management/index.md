# Customer Management

## Overview
⚠️ **PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - VEHICLE-CENTRIC APPROACH**

The Customer Management module describes planned comprehensive relationship management capabilities. Currently, customer and vendor information is managed through the Vehicle Management system with basic customer/vendor ID associations. Dedicated CRM applications are planned for future implementation.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Currently Available (Vehicle-Centric)
- **Basic Vendor References** - Vendor ID fields in vehicle master data
- **Customer Associations** - Customer, sales order customer, and end customer ID fields
- **Vehicle-Customer Linking** - Customer information tied to specific vehicles
- **Warranty Customer Data** - Customer information in warranty claims and profiles

### ⚠️ Planned CRM Applications

#### [Vendor & Customer Management](vendor-customer.md)
*Future: Comprehensive management system for both suppliers and customers*
- Unified vendor and customer profiles with relationship hierarchy
- Performance tracking and risk assessment
- Contract management and compliance monitoring
- Analytics-driven relationship optimization

#### [End Customer Management](end-customer.md)
*Future: Specialized retail customer management*
- Detailed customer profiles with preferences and buying patterns
- Customer lifecycle management and journey optimization
- Personalization engine with AI-driven recommendations
- Privacy compliance and data protection
