# Vehicle Management and Warranty System

## Overview

The Vehicle Management and Warranty System delivers enterprise-grade capabilities for automotive organizations managing vehicle inventories, warranty operations, and service networks. Built using SAP CAP (Cloud Application Programming) framework, the system provides extensive configurability, seamless ERP integration, and comprehensive business process support tailored to automotive industry requirements.

## System Architecture

The platform consists of two integrated core modules that work together to provide complete vehicle lifecycle management:

### Core Modules
- **Vehicle Management**: Comprehensive vehicle data management with advanced configuration capabilities
- **Warranty Management**: Full-featured claim processing and recall campaign orchestration

### Technical Foundation
- Built on SAP CAP for enterprise scalability and reliability
- Microservices architecture with defined service boundaries
- RESTful APIs for all operations
- Real-time data synchronization across modules
- Extensive configurability without code modification

## Core Modules

### [Vehicle Management](./vehicle-management/README.md)
Comprehensive vehicle lifecycle management from registration to retirement. The system handles everything from basic vehicle data to complex fleet operations with customizable fields, advanced search capabilities, and document management. Perfect for dealerships, fleet operators, and service networks requiring detailed vehicle tracking and history management.

### [Warranty Management](./warranty-management/README.md)
End-to-end warranty claim processing and campaign management. From claim templates that streamline submissions to sophisticated recall campaign coordination, this module transforms warranty operations. Service advisors can quickly create claims while warranty managers maintain full visibility and control over the entire warranty process.

## Integration with SAP

The Vehicle Management and Warranty System is designed to complement and enhance your existing SAP landscape. Sales processes remain within your standard SAP SD (Sales and Distribution) module, leveraging the robust capabilities already embedded in SAP for order management, pricing, billing, and customer management. Our solution integrates seamlessly with SAP, providing specialized vehicle and warranty functionality while respecting the proven sales processes you already have in place.

This approach ensures you maintain the full power of SAP's sales capabilities - from complex pricing procedures to credit management - while gaining industry-specific vehicle and warranty management features that standard SAP doesn't provide out of the box.
