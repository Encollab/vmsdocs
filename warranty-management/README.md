# Warranty Management Module

## Overview

The Warranty Management module provides comprehensive warranty claim processing and campaign management capabilities for automotive organizations. Built to handle the complexities of modern warranty operations, the system manages everything from individual service claims to large-scale recall campaigns while maintaining complete integration with vehicle records and external business systems.

## Core Functionality

### Claim Processing System

The warranty system centers around a sophisticated claim management structure that handles multiple claim scenarios. Each claim captures essential information including authorization numbers, business partners, repair dates, mileage, and operating hours. The system supports both manual claim entry and automated processing flows, with comprehensive status tracking throughout the claim lifecycle.

Claims are structured with header-level information and detailed line items, allowing for complex multi-part repairs and varied pricing scenarios. Each claim item can track different financial amounts for incoming claimant costs, incoming vendor costs, outgoing claimant reimbursements, and outgoing vendor payments, providing complete financial transparency.

### Template Management

Claim templates streamline the warranty process by providing pre-configured claim structures for common scenarios. Service advisors can select from a library of templates that automatically populate standard repair information, parts, labor operations, and documentation requirements.

Templates are managed centrally with full lifecycle control. Each template defines:
- Standard claim classifications (type, group, coverage)
- Pre-populated line items with materials and quantities
- Default financial allocations
- Required documentation specifications

Templates serve dual purposes - they can be used for individual service claims or as the foundation for recall campaigns, ensuring consistency across different claim scenarios while reducing data entry time and errors.

### Master Warranty Configuration

The Master Warranty system defines warranty coverage profiles that automatically determine claim eligibility. Each profile specifies:
- Coverage duration (minimum and maximum days from purchase)
- Mileage limitations (minimum and maximum mileage ranges)
- Parts and labor coverage inclusion
- Financial split percentages between OEM, dealer, and vendor
- Temporal validity periods for profile applicability

These profiles link to specific vehicle models and automatically validate coverage when claims are submitted, eliminating manual coverage verification and reducing claim rejection rates.

### Recall Campaign Management

The recall campaign system orchestrates complex vehicle recall and service campaign operations. Campaigns can be regulatory-mandated recalls or voluntary service actions, each with configurable priority levels and completion requirements.

Campaign features include:
- Campaign creation with title, description, affected parts, and regulatory references
- Vehicle assignment based on VIN ranges, model years, or specific criteria
- Dealer allocation for campaign execution
- Scheduled appointment management
- Progress tracking with real-time completion statistics
- Automatic claim generation using predefined templates

### Version Management

Every warranty claim maintains a complete version history, capturing all changes throughout its lifecycle. The versioning system creates immutable snapshots of claims, including:
- Complete claim header data at each version
- Line item changes with original item references
- Text modifications and custom field updates
- Version creation metadata (who, when, why)
- Change type classification (created, modified, deleted)

A sophisticated version comparison feature allows side-by-side analysis of claim changes, providing complete audit trails for compliance and dispute resolution.

### Field Control System

The field control system provides granular control over data visibility and editability based on claim status and user context. Configuration options include:
- Hidden fields (not displayed to users)
- Read-only fields (visible but not editable)
- Optional fields (editable but not required)
- Mandatory fields (must be completed before progression)

Field controls can differentiate between internal and external users, ensuring appropriate data access for different user groups. Over 40 claim-level fields and multiple item-level fields can be individually controlled, providing precise data governance.

### Custom Fields and Extensions

Organizations can extend the standard warranty structure with custom fields to capture business-specific information. The custom field system supports:
- Multiple field types (text, boolean, number, date, datetime, textarea)
- Required and optional field configurations
- Default value specifications
- Entity-specific fields (claims, claim items, campaigns)
- Full integration with search and reporting functions

Custom fields maintain usage tracking, allowing administrators to understand field utilization and clean up unused extensions.

### Document Management

Comprehensive attachment capabilities support the documentation requirements of warranty operations. The system handles:
- Multiple file types and formats
- Automatic association with claims and vehicles
- Document categorization and metadata
- Retention policy support
- Integration with external document management systems

### Text Management

Configurable text types allow organizations to capture various narrative information:
- Internal notes and comments
- Customer communication
- Technical descriptions
- Repair instructions
- Regulatory notifications

Text types can be configured with specific icons and categories, organizing information for easy retrieval and display.

## Integration Capabilities
