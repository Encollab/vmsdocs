# Documentation Migration Summary

## What Changed

We've restructured the VMS documentation from individual uppercase files into a proper website-ready documentation structure.

## Migration Map

| Old File | New Location | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| `API_SERVICE_REFERENCE.md` | `docs/integration/api-reference.md` | ✅ Migrated |
| `APP_FUNCTIONALITY_GUIDE.md` | `docs/modules/*/index.md` (split across modules) | ✅ Migrated |
| `TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` | `docs/platform/architecture.md` | ✅ Migrated |
| `FUNCTIONAL_SPECIFICATIONS.md` | `docs/configuration/*.md` & `docs/modules/*.md` | ✅ Migrated |
| `DEVELOPER_CHECKLISTS.md` | `docs/development/feature-backlog.md` | ✅ Migrated |
| `MARKETING_FEATURES.md` | `docs/platform/features.md` (factual version) | ✅ Migrated |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` | `docs/platform/implementation-status.md` | ✅ Migrated |

## Files to Keep

These files should NOT be deleted:
- `CLAUDE.md` - AI assistant configuration
- `README.md` - Main project readme  
- `todo.md` - Original task list
- `wty.md` - Warranty notes
- `mkdocs.yml` - Documentation site configuration
- `docs/` - Entire new documentation folder

## New Structure Benefits

### Before
- Individual files with uppercase names
- No clear navigation structure
- Mixed audiences in single files
- Difficult to serve as website

### After
- Organized folder structure
- Clear navigation with index files
- Audience-specific sections
- Ready for static site generation
- Lowercase filenames (web-friendly)
- Mermaid diagrams integrated
- Factual content (no made-up statistics)

## To Clean Up

Run the cleanup script:
```bash
./cleanup-old-docs.sh
```

This will:
1. Create a backup folder `old-docs-backup/`
2. Move old files to backup
3. Keep essential files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.)
4. Leave your new `docs/` structure intact

## To Serve Documentation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocs-mermaid2-plugin

# Serve locally
mkdocs serve

# Browse to http://localhost:8000
```

## What's Now Available

### For Business Users
- Clear feature descriptions at `docs/platform/features.md`
- Module documentation at `docs/modules/*/`
- User guides at `docs/user-guide/`

### For Developers  
- Feature backlog at `docs/development/feature-backlog.md`
- API reference at `docs/integration/api-reference.md`
- Setup guide at `docs/development/setup.md`

### For Administrators

- Integration docs at `docs/integration/`
- System settings at `docs/configuration/system.md`

## Implementation Status

The documentation accurately reflects:
- **40% overall completion**
- **Operational**: Vehicle, Warranty, Budget, Recall modules
- **Partial**: Service (40%), Customer (20%) modules
- **Planned**: Procurement & Sales, Inventory modules

All statistics and percentages are based on actual implementation, not marketing projections.
